  @Summary
    This function would write the rising dead band count into CWG2DBR registers

  @Description
    This function can be used to modify rising dead band count of CWG on the fly

    When module is disabled, the CWG2DBR register is loaded immediately when
    CWG2DBR is written. When module is enabled, then software must set the
    CWG2CON0<LD> bit, and the buffer will be loaded at the next falling edge of
    the CWG input signal.

  @Preconditions
    CWG2_Initialize() function should have been called before calling this function

  @Returns
    None

  @Param
    value - 6 bit digital rising dead band count to CWG.

  @Example
    <code>
    uint8_t myDutyValue;

    CWG2_Initialize();

    // do something

    CWG1_LoadRiseDeadbandCount(myDutyValue);

    When module is disabled, the CWG2DBF register is loaded immediately when
    CWG2DBF is written. When module is enabled, then software must set the
    CWG2CON0<LD> bit, and the buffer will be loaded at the rising edge of CWG
    input signal after the next falling edge (that is, after the falling-edge update.

    None

  @Param
    None

/**
  @Summary
    This function makes the CWG to resume its operations from the software
    generated shutdown state.

  @Description
    When auto-restart is disabled, the shutdown state will persist as long as the
    CWG2AS0<SHUTDOWN> bit is set and hence to resume operations, this function should be used.

    However when auto-restart is enabled, the CWG2AS0<SHUTDOWN> bit will be cleared automatically
    and resume operation on the next rising edge event. In that case, there is no
    need to call this function.

  @Preconditions
    CWG2_Initialize() and CWG2_AutoShutdownEventSet() functions should have been called before calling this function

  @Returns
    None

  @Param
    None
