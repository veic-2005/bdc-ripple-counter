   @Summary
     This is the generated driver implementation file for the COG3 driver using PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs
 
   @Description
     This source file provides implementations for driver APIs for COG3.
     Generation Information :
         Product Revision  :  PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs - 1.76
         Device            :  PIC16F1779
         Driver Version    :  2.01
     The generated drivers are tested against the following:
         Compiler          :  XC8 2.00

    None

    None

/**
  @Summary
    This function makes the COG to resume its operations from the software
    generated shutdown state.

  @Description
    When auto-restart is disabled, the shutdown state will persist as long as the
    GxASE bit is set and hence to resume operations, this function should be used.

    However when auto-restart is enabled, the GxASE bit will clear automatically
    and resume operation on the next rising edge event. In that case, there is no
    need to call this function.

  @Preconditions
    COG3_Initialize() and COG3_AutoShutdownEventSet() functions should have been called before calling this function

  @Returns
    None

  @Param
    None

  @Example
    <code>
    COG3_initialize();

    // Do something

    COG3_AutoShutdownEventSet();

    // Do something

    COG3_AutoShutdownEventClear();
